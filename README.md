# 📊 Mortgage Credit Risk Dashboard (Power BI)

This Power BI dashboard analyzes and visualizes mortgage loan credit risk data from **2019 to 2024**. It is designed to monitor risk exposure, track portfolio health, and highlight trends in loan origination and performance over time.

## Key Insights

- **High LTV Loan Percentage** – Track loans with LTV > 80%
- **Default Rate** – Percentage of loans marked as "Default"
- **Average DTI & Interest Rates** – See changes across years
- **Loan Status Breakdown** – Visualized through pie and line charts
- **Property Type & Origination Trends** – Analyze borrower behavior over time

## 🔧 Tools Used

- **Power BI** – Data modeling, DAX, visualization
- **Excel** – Synthetic dataset
- **Domain Expertise** – Credit Risk in Banking & Mortgage

## 📌 Project Insights

1. **High LTV Loan Share**  
   A significant portion of loans originated during 2021–2023 had **Loan-to-Value (LTV) ratios above 80%**, indicating higher credit exposure for lenders during that period.

2. **Default Rate Patterns**  
   The **default rate peaked in 2020**, likely due to macroeconomic stress (e.g., pandemic impacts), and gradually declined afterward, suggesting improved borrower behavior or tighter lending criteria.

3. **Average Debt-to-Income (DTI) Ratio**  
   The average DTI remained relatively steady over the years, but **2023 showed a slight increase**, possibly linked to inflation or income volatility.

4. **Interest Rate Trends**  
   A sharp **rise in average interest rates was observed in 2022 and 2023**, likely due to central bank rate hikes. This may have impacted loan affordability and risk.

5. **Loan Origination Volume**  
   Origination volume peaked in **2021**, reflecting a period of strong housing demand and low interest rates, followed by a decline in **2023–2024**, possibly due to tighter credit or economic uncertainty.

6. **Property Type Distribution**  
   The majority of loans were issued for **Single-Family** properties. **Multi-Family** loans, though fewer, showed slightly higher risk indicators (LTV and DTI).
